How the template file was created
=================================

The file was created from SEQUOIA_30676_event.nxs.

Removed:
* SNSHitoTool
* bank??_events/event_id(index, time_offset, time_zero)
* instrument/bank??/event_id(index, time_offset, time_zero)
* all children of DASlogs except "proton_charge"



Modifying template to create simulated SEQUOIA event nexus file
===============================================================

To create a SEQUOIA events file we need to copy the template file
to a new file, and do the following updates:

* bank*_events: add fields 
  * event_id: pixel ID for the events
  * event_time_offset: tof offset for the events
  * event_weight: weights of neutron events
  * event_index: should be an array of size 2. first element 0, second element # of events.
  * event_time_zero: neutron pulse time. should be an array of size 2. first element 0, second element 0.016666666

* bank*_events: 
  * total_counts

* bank*: 
  * data_x_y: histogram[x,y]. shape=8,128

* total_counts



To think about soon
-------------------

* proton_charge
* monitors: monitor1, monitor2
* sample
* DASlogs



Not critical
------------
* time signatures: start_time, end_time, duration
* definition
* notes
* title
* collection_identifier, collectioin_titile
* entry_identifier, experiment_identifier
* raw_frames
* run_number
* users: user1/2/3
