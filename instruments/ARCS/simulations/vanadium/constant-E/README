Introduction
============

ARCS instrument: scattering from a vanadium sample.

incident neutrons: can be neutrons at sample position from mod2sample
simulation for ARCS


Setup
=====
Make sure there is a file "incident-neutrons".
It could be a symbolic link.
Must be a mcvine neutron data file.
Neutrons must have been saved at z=13.45 of ARCS instrument.


Run
===

To run this simulation, 

 $ ./run

Quick check of simulation:

 $ ./check-...
