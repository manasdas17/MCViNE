given saved neutrons at sample position from ../mod2sample,
compute I(Q,E) spetrum of a sample with delta function scattering kernel

S(Q,E) = delta(Q-Q0, E-E0)

It includes scattering, and sending to detector system,
and reduction.

This is different from sample-scattering-deltaQE, which only has
the scattering part.
