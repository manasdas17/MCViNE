vulcan_asbuilt_L2d.instr

Brief model description:
- the model reflects the instrument configuration as of now (July 2010)
- asbuilt dimensions and reflectivity profiels of guide systems
- first bandwidth chopper installed; second chopper position empty
- the last guide element of 1 meter length called funnel is not installed
- a Vanadium sample is inserted
- the left detector banks are modellled with a crude pixelation
- the source is a parameterized representation of one pulse running SNS at 2MW and 60 Hz.repetition rate

Parameters:
- frequency of bandwidth chopper (default=60Hz)
- center of wavelength band (determines chopper phase) (default=1.5 Angstroem)
- instrument mode=hint (high-intensity); mode=hres (high-resolution) (defulat=hint)
- PSD_TEW_monitor output format: table/McStas (default=table)
