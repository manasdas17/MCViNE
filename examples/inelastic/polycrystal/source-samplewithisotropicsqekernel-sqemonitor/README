This example simulates a inelastic scattering from a sample with a isotropic
S(Q,E) kernel:

 S(Q,E) = 1  for all Q, E

The sampleassembly is defined in directory "sampleassembly".
Please read sampleassembly/README for details of the files in there.

To run the simulation, execute

 $ ./sim

It will take a while to finish. When finish, you can see the result
of I(Q,E) from the IQE_monitor by

 $ PlotHist.py out/iqe_monitor.h5
