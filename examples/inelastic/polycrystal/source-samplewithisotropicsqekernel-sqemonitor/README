This example simulates a inelastic scattering from a sample with a isotropic
S(Q,E) kernel:

 S(Q,E) = 1  for all Q, E

The sampleassembly is defined in directory "sampleassembly".
Please read sampleassembly/README for details of the files in there.

To run the simulation, execute

 $ ./sim

It will take a while to finish. When finish, you can see the result
of I(Q,E) from the IQE_monitor by

 $ PlotHist.py out/iqe_monitor.h5



The S(Q,E) data for simulation is supplied in histogram hdf5 data
format in sampleassembly/isotropicsqe.h5.

If you have your own S(Q,E) in hdf5 format, you can change 
sampleassembly/Ni-plate-sqekernel-isotropicsqe-scatterer.xml
to use your S(Q,E) file, and run simulation again.

The size of the sample is set to very small, and the source
is real monochromatic, so the I(Q,E)
obtained is actually almost identical to the input
S(Q,E) histogram. To see more effects of instrument resolution,
you can try changing the source and the sample dimension, for
example.
