This example simulates a inelastic scattering from a sample with a
S(Q,E) kernel. The S(Q,E) is supplied as an analytical function
in sampleassembly/Al-sqekernel-analyticalsqe-plate-scatterer.xml.

The sampleassembly is defined in directory "sampleassembly".
Please read sampleassembly/README for details of the files in there.

To run the simulation, execute

 $ ./sim

It will take a while to finish. When finish, you can see the result
of I(Q,E) from the IQE_monitor by

 $ PlotHist.py out/iqe_monitor.h5

The analytical function supplied has a sin like dispersion.
You should see it in the I(Q,E) plotted.
