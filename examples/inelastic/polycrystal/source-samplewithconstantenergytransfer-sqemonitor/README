This example simulates a inelastic scattering from a sample with a
constant-energy-transfer kernel.
The constant-energy-transfer kernel scatters neutrons isotropically with
constant energy transfer (specified in 
sampleassembly/Al-constantenergytransfer-kernel-plate-scatterer.xml)

The sampleassembly is defined in directory "sampleassembly".
Please read sampleassembly/README for details of the files in there.

To run the simulation, execute

 $ ./sim

It will take a while to finish. When finish, you can see the result
of I(Q,E) from the IQE_monitor by

 $ PlotHist.py out/iqe_monitor.h5

In the I(Q,E) plot you should only see one horizontal line
due to constant energy transfer.
